#set( $str = "${project.version}" )

    <<IMPORTANT: This is a SNAPSHOT version of the repository which may change at any time.

    * Minor code clean-up with no functional effect.

    developer's own global <<<~/.gitignore>>> file instead.

    []

* 1.40.2

    * Added <<<getMapcodeFormatType>>> and <<<isValidMapcodeFormat>>> to check validity of mapcode strings. Added
    unit tests for these methods as well.

    * Constructor of <<<Mapcode>>> now checks for validity of mapcode string.

    * Added Unicode handling of high precision mapcodes and added check to throw an <<<IllegalArgumentException>>>
    if the character 'Z' or equivalent Unicode character is contained in the high precision part according to
    the Mapcode documenation.

    * Added method <<<convertToAscii>>> which produces the ASCII, non-Unicode variant of a mapcode which contains
    Unicode characters§.
